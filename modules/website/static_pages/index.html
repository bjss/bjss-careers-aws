    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <p>
      You are a consultant assigned to a client who runs an existing application in AWS. All of the AWS configuration is deployed using Terraform. All of the CI/CD pipelines are constructed using GitHub Actions. You have been granted access to the application, the AWS account and the GitHub repo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The application is an image sharing tool. This tool will take an image provided by a user, create copies of it at multiple resolutions, and store them ready to be shared or downloaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a number of tasks defined in the "issues" tab of the GitHub repo. Each of these is written by the tech lead who is looking for help with a particular part of the solution or project. You should choose one of these tasks to work on. The amount of time you spend on the task is entirely up to you; however, we recommend that you spend at least 1 hour on the task.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your solution for the task will vary depending on which one you choose, but you should plan to talk about it for around 20 minutes and be prepared to answer clarifying questions about what you present.
